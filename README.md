Uses pygame (http://www.pygame.org/).<br/>
A variation of the game "Set".<br/>
Known bug: having 15 cards on the deck and removing the set moves the whole table.<br/>
Also the Squiggle texture looks quite bad.<br/>
engine.py was cut badly, maybe it'd better to unite it with data.py<br/>
Press Up to see set in the console.<br/><br/>
Bugged programs must die by themselves. This one dies. Yet.<br/>
Things to add:<br/>
0. Interface, icons, graphics, countdowns, colours<br/>
1. .exe<br/>
2. more bugs
