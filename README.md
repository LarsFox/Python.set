This "game" uses pygame.<br/>
<br/>
You can download it from... well, I'll attach link a bit later<br/>
Still. This thing does not work!<br/>
It just draws some stuff, waits, then dies.<br/>
<br/>
Better than blinking with zero cooldown/freezing/lagging etc.<br/>
<br/>
Bugged programs must die by themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
